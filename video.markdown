## Music Videos

# Songs About UC Berkeley
This series of six music videos was created one at a time, once per semester, during Spencer's last 3 years as a student at UC Berkeley. All of them were humorous "meme" songs intended to be posted on the "UC Berkeley Memes for Edgy Teens" group, which at the time was the most popular college meme group on Facebook. Each recieved thousands of reactions on Facebook. Everything in the videos, from the music composition to the filming to the editing, was done by Spencer.

# Multitracked Performances
These videos, which are all cover songs, showcase the use of multiple performances recorded over each other to create fuller-sounding covers.
